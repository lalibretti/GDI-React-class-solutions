# Class 3 Homework update our project to include properties in our components
1. Data has been included in Homepage.jsx.  Take a look at data.json - we need to extract the photos array from it.  How could we do that?  (hint: destructuring!)


2. How can we get those photos from <Homepage/> component to <FeedList/> component?  (hint: props!)


3. For each photo that gets passed down to <FeedList/>, we need to create a <FeedItem/>
for each individual photo.  (hint: use the map function!)


4. The img inside of <FeedItem/> needs to display the src url that gets passed to it.


5. <Likes/> component needs to display the number of likes passed down to it.



# Class 2 Homework -update the following files: App.js, HomePage.jsx, and the files in the components folder

1. write a class component with a dic and appropriate class name
2. import the necessary files
3. add them to the div
4. export the default component
** The pages that are to be updated will have page specific instructions **

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
